# tic-tac-toe-odin

# This is a tic tac toe project for the odin project

<!-- 
Tasks:
1. store gameboard as an array inside GameBoard object
2. Focus on getting a working gae going in the console
3. create an object that will handle the display/DOM logic. Write a function that will render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage (for now, you can always just fill the gameboard array with "X"s and "O"s just to see what’s going on).
4. Write the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board by interacting with the appropriate DOM elements (e.g. letting players click on a board square to place their marker). Don’t forget the logic that keeps players from playing in spots that are already taken!
5. Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that shows the results upon game end!
